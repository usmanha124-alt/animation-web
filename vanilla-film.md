# Vanilla scroll-film architecture

One HTML page + one JS engine + a folder of WebP frames. Working templates:
`assets/scrubber-index.html` and `assets/scrubber-main.js` (taken verbatim
from the shipped coffee-scroll site). Copy both into the new project, then
rebrand — don't rewrite the engine.

## Project layout

```
<project>/
├── index.html      # captions, styling, brand — edit heavily
├── main.js         # scrubber engine — edit rarely
├── frames/         # frame_0001.webp … + frames.json (build_master.py output)
├── assets/         # source clips/stills/master (never shipped; .gitignore)
├── tools/hf.py     # copy from skill scripts/, plus a .env with HF_KEY
└── .env
```

## How the engine works (so you can debug it)

- `#track` is a tall div (~900vh) with a `position: sticky` full-viewport
  stage; scroll progress = scrollY / (track height − viewport).
- All frame blobs are fetched up front (~20 MB); only a sliding window of
  ±120 decoded ImageBitmaps exists at once (mobile RAM). Loader gates on the
  first ~15% of frames.
- A time-based lerp (`1 − exp(−dt·14)`) smooths the target frame so fast
  flicks glide and throttled tabs still converge.
- Frames are 4:3 — drawn contain-fit over a bg-matched fill, with a CSS
  vignette + edge gradients hiding the letterbox seam.
- Captions are absolutely-positioned divs with `data-in/hold/out` scroll
  fractions; opacity is computed per frame in `updateCaptions`. Give the
  opening title `data-in="-0.05"` so it's visible at scroll 0.

## Rebranding checklist

1. CSS vars: `--bg`, accent (`--brass`), text colors. Keep bg near-black so
   frames blend.
2. Brand name in loader, title caption, final card, outro, `<title>`.
3. Captions: one per chapter + opening title + final card with CTA.
   Recalibrate every `data-in/hold/out` from build_master's printed
   fractions — put each caption's window inside its chapter, peak ~60-80%
   through it (assembly-type chapters: caption when the product is mostly
   formed, not mid-storm).
4. Track height: ~120vh per chapter feels right (900vh for 7 chapters).
5. Replace the template's `#outro` stub with the full brand page —
   sections, nav and footer from `assets/brand-sections.html`, guidance in
   `references/brand-page.md`. The film alone is not a finished site.

## Serve

Add to `~/test saas/.claude/launch.json` (`python3 -m http.server <port>
-d <project>`), pick the next free port (existing: 4173-4188, 3002). For
user-facing hosting run the same command as a background Bash task and
`open http://localhost:<port>`.
